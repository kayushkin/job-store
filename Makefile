# The sqlite_fts5 tag is not optional and not a preference.
#
# schema.sql creates an FTS5 virtual table, and mattn/go-sqlite3 compiles FTS5
# into its bundled SQLite only when this build tag is set. A binary built without
# it compiles cleanly, links cleanly, and then dies at boot with
# "no such module: fts5". Every target here carries the tag so nobody has to
# remember it, and Open() names the flag if a binary built elsewhere shows up.
